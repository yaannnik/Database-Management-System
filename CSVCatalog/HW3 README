This project contains the following files:

README.md

CSVCatalog.py
CSVTable.py
DataTableExceptions.py

unit_test_catalog.py: The test file provided and any additional tests your write.
unit_test_catalog.txt: A file containing the execution of your tests.
unit_test_csv_table.py: A test file provided and any additional tests you write.
unit_test_csv_table.txt: A file containing the execution of your tests.

People.csv
Appearances.csv
Batting.csv

create.sql: SQL statements to create tables and constraints for the catalog.


CSVCatalog: Creates the methods that interact with the SQL database to store the metadata tables
This ensures table integrity is kept using MySQL rather than implementing integrity constraints ourselves. 

Note: The create statements provided in create.sql must be run before executing CSVCatalog to ensure metadata tables are created correctly.

In CSVCatalog there are 4 classes created: ColumnDefinition, IndexDefinition, TableDefinition, and CSVCatalog.
CSV Catalog is the class the creates, drops, and loads a table.
A table definition is defined by file name and columns and indexes on those columns. These are created and column and index objects in ColumnDefiniton and IndexDefiniton.

CSVTable is the file that loads the metadata and csvfiles for specific tables. It is where the joins are created and acts more like a traditional MySQL workbench where you can access rows of data based off certain fields and join tables together. Find by template both via an index and a table scan has been implemented as well. 

DataTableExceptions is a given file that raises specific exceptions.

There are four test files, one testing and one containing the results of the tests for both the CSVTable and CSVCatalog. 

The data attached which was used in testing are People.csv, Appearances.csv, and Batting.csv.
The indexes you should define and test (at a minimum) are:
	People: playerID as PK people
			nameLast, nameFirst as last_first

	Batting: playerID, stint, yearID as PK batting
			 yearID as YearID

	Appearances: yearID, teamID, playerID as PK appearances

One of the methods in unit_test_csv_table.py will create the indexes mentioned above. To add additional indexes follow the same method. 

Note all test only on three tables: People, Appearances, and Batting. These csv files can be found in this zip as well.

Finally this folder contains the create.sql file which will create the metadata schema required for running CSVCatalog as mentioned previously.
Please run this file first as the metadata tables must be created properly before anything else will work.

Put any information you would like us to read below this line.
You should include any helper methods you added, additional tests your ran, additional features, and any issues/errors.
